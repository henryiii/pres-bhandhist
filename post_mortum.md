# boost-histogram

* Released 0.5.0 the day before the talk
* Slides and live demo
    - Demo from Binder, also local option
    - Some attendees were using
    - Chris was working on Conda-Forge packaging for it
* Released 0.5.1 at the end of PyHEP
    - Critical fixes found during tutorial design
    - One feature that missed the deadline (`.axes`)
    - A few bug reports fixed
* Still to do
    - Fixed issue with Python (3.8) + Windows build
    - Conda-Forge package by Chris still needs this fix
    - `bh.loc(x)+1` and better repr's planned for 0.5.2

# Other

* Volunteered to give topical Python 3.8 features talk
* Gave lightning talk too (one slide)


## Other topics
* Good showing from Conda-Forge ROOT, Particle, and more
    * Build system from boost-histogram already showing up in iMinuit, Awkward


## From the other side
* PyROOT plans sound good (but still missing things like macOS and some collaborators on Conda-Forge slide)
* Bamboo: A RDataFrame powered analysis framework sounded interesting
